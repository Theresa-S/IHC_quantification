# IHC_quantification
This is an ImageJ macro designed to characterize IHC staining (default: %area and mean intensity)

The optical density as a surrogate marker for staining intensity can be calculated as: -log10(mean intensity/max intensity). Please keep in mind that there might be differences introduced during staining or image acquisition.
